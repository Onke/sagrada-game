# sagrada-game
This is a mobile version of the board game Sagrada. Sagrada is a dice placement game where players assemble dice, represent the glass's colour and shade, and place them in their window - carefully following restrictions while adding their artistic flair. This mobile game is a Client-Server version of Sagrada with a console-based server(https://github.com/Onke/sagrada-server) created in Java.

To play the game you will need to also download the sagrada server. Run the server and enter the IP address on from the erver in the 4 android devices. Have fun!
